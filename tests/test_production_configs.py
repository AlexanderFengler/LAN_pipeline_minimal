"""Every committed `production_<model>/` pair has to be internally coherent.

Recording production runs as committed configs is only worth the convention if
the recording is checked. It is not hypothetical: backfilling
`production_ddm_sdv/` from the cluster caught two values that had been copied
from `configs/examples/` and never corrected -- `SHUFFLE: True` (wrong for a
loader that advances files on batch index) and `CPU_BATCH_SIZE: 1000` (a
fiftieth of the GPU batch, so a CPU fallback would not have been the same
problem). Neither would have failed loudly; both would have quietly made the
next run un-reproducible from the repo.

These are cheap structural checks, not a schema. The pipeline's own loaders own
the schema; this owns the things that are only wrong in context.

It also owns `derived_<model>/network_training_{cpn,opn}.yaml`, which have no
generation pair and are checked against derive-aux's fixed rows-per-file
instead.
