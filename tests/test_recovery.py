"""Tests for the recovery harness.

Fast and offline throughout. The statistical core — does a fit recover the
truth — is not unit-testable in CI; it is exercised by the pilot and by the
harness self-test described in the plan (analytical L0, where recovery is well
established, so a failure indicts the harness rather than the model). What is
tested here is everything that decides *whether the numbers mean anything*: the
design construction, the convergence filter, and the attribution rules that
charge a failure to the network only when a no-network reference did better.

Two models are used throughout rather than one, because the harness is a recipe
and a recipe that has only ever run on `ddm_sdv` is a `ddm_sdv` script. `angle`
adds a parameter with a negative lower bound; `race_no_bias_angle_4` has four
choices, eight parameters and a drift called `v0`.
