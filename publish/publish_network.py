"""Publish a trained network to HuggingFace, and record that it happened.

This is the step that turns a training run into a file every released HSSM
will download. It runs from the laptop, never the cluster: the HuggingFace
token is laptop-only, and the validation gate needs the laptop's HSSM
environment anyway.

The flow:

    resolve   — find the training run in MLflow by id, or by model +
                network type. The discriminator for "training actually
                finished" is the presence of the ``run_uuid`` tag, not the
                run's status: the submitting process ends its own run right
                after sbatch returns, so a job that has not started yet
                already reads FINISHED.
    stage     — copy every artifact whose name carries that run_uuid into a
                private directory. LANfactory writes all runs of a model into
                one flat folder, so publishing straight from it would upload
                other runs' files, silently disable the parity gate, and
                write a model card into the training output.
    validate  — run the gate against the staged ONNX. A gate that skipped is
                not a gate that passed; see ``gate_verdict``.
    upload    — lanfactory's dual-layout upload: the full artifact set under
                ``{network_type}/{model}/`` plus the canonical ONNX at the
                repo root under the name HSSM looks for.
    record    — a publish run in MLflow holding the source run, the resulting
                commit and the gate scores, and tags on the training run
                saying where it went.

One caveat worth knowing: the record is written wherever MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI
points. If that is a *mirror* pulled down from the cluster, these writes live
only in the local copy and the next pull discards them. Point it at the
authoritative store when the record needs to survive.
