"""Publish a trained network to HuggingFace, and record that it happened.

This is the step that turns a training run into a file every released HSSM
will download. It runs from the laptop, never the cluster: the HuggingFace
token is laptop-only, and the validation gate needs the laptop's HSSM
environment anyway.

The flow:

    resolve   — find the training run in MLflow by id, or by model +
                network type. The discriminator for "training actually
                finished" is the presence of the ``run_uuid`` tag, not the
                run's status: the submitting process ends its own run right
                after sbatch returns, so a job that has not started yet
                already reads FINISHED.
    stage     — copy every artifact whose name carries that run_uuid into a
                private directory. LANfactory writes all runs of a model into
                one flat folder, so publishing straight from it would upload
                other runs' files, silently disable the parity gate, and
                write a model card into the training output.
    validate  — run the gate against the staged ONNX. A gate that skipped is
                not a gate that passed; see ``gate_verdict``.
    upload    — lanfactory's dual-layout upload: the full artifact set under
                ``{network_type}/{model}/`` plus the canonical ONNX at the
                repo root under the name HSSM looks for.
    record    — a publish run in MLflow holding the source run, the resulting
                commit and the gate scores, and tags on the training run
                saying where it went.

An auxiliary network (cpn / opn) takes the same path with three differences:
the required gates are the auxiliary set (``REQUIRED_GATES_BY_NETWORK_TYPE``),
the training run must carry the provenance of the LAN it was derived from
(``aux_provenance``), and a model card is generated from that provenance and
the gate report when the operator staged none (``write_aux_model_card``).
A gonogo network is never published — nothing in HSSM consumes one — and a
``_deadline`` model name is refused, since HSSM builds the root filename from
the base model. Both refusals fire before anything is staged or validated.

One caveat worth knowing: the record is written wherever MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI
points. If that is a *mirror* pulled down from the cluster, these writes live
only in the local copy and the next pull discards them. Point it at the
authoritative store when the record needs to survive.
