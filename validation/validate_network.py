"""Validate a trained likelihood network before it is published.

Publishing puts a file under a name every released HSSM downloads, so the
question this answers is narrow: *would HSSM load this and get sane numbers?*

Four gates, cheapest first, each independently reported so a failure says
which property broke:

    G1 structure  — ONNX loads, onnxruntime builds a session, every input dim
                    is concrete, exactly one tensor goes in and one log-density
                    comes out, and the input width matches the parameter space
                    (the ecosystem's single-trial contract).
    G2 parity     — ONNX output equals the trainer's own jax forward pass,
                    when the *_train_state.jax sibling is present.
    G3 hssm-load  — hssm.HSSM accepts it as a likelihood and produces a finite
                    initial logp on simulated data.
    G4 density    — the network's implied density integrates to ~1 and matches
                    simulation (Hellinger) at several in-bounds parameter
                    draws. This is the only gate that catches a network that
                    loads perfectly and has learned nothing.

G1-G3 are mechanical. G4 is statistical, and it calibrates itself against the
sampling noise of the simulator rather than against a fixed number — see
DEFAULT_HELLINGER_RATIO_MAX.

A LAN gets a fifth, advisory gate after G4:

    G5 mass_survey — the network's total mass (summed over choices, integrated
                    over rt on LANfactory's onset-refined grid) is surveyed at
                    20 000 θ over the FULL training box, and the tails of the
                    |total − 1| distribution are judged. G4 samples five θ from
                    the 10 %-shrunk box, so it cannot see the defective regions
                    a survey of the published ddm LAN found at the box edge
                    (1.9 % of the box beyond 0.05, up to +0.22); it would fail
                    that network with probability 0.06 %. The survey needs
                    ``lanfactory.derive`` and skips itself, with a stated
                    reason, while the lock pins a LANfactory without it.

Auxiliary networks (cpn / opn / gonogo) are not densities, so G3 and G4 do not
apply to them. They get their own pair after G1 and G2:

    A3 hssm-missing-load — hssm.HSSM accepts the network as
                    ``loglik_missing_data`` next to the base LAN and produces a
                    finite initial logp on simulated data with missing rows,
                    at p_outlier = 0 and at HSSM's default lapse.
    A4 accuracy   — the network's probability matches a Monte-Carlo truth at
                    several in-bounds parameter draws (see aux_truth). This is
                    the gate that notices an untrained or mis-categorised net.

The auxiliary contract every gate here enforces (``--model-name`` is always the
BASE model; the ``_deadline`` variant is derived internally):

    cpn     input [θ in list_params order, extra_fields..., choice], width
            n_params + 1, output log P_s(choice | θ)
    opn     input [θ..., deadline], width n_params + 1,
            output log S_s(deadline | θ) = log P_s(rt > deadline | θ)
    gonogo  input [θ..., deadline], width n_params + 1,
            output log P_s(nogo ∪ omission | θ) — derived only, no HSSM consumer

Outputs are SSM-only marginals with the log-sigmoid baked into the graph, so
every value is ≤ 0; HSSM applies the lapse mixture outside the network.

On the cpn truth: ssms does NOT censor a base model at max_t. A trial that has
not terminated by max_t comes back at rt ≈ max_t + t with its sign-implied
choice, while a derived CPN integrates the first-passage density only up to
max_t (20 s). aux_truth therefore reports both ``truth`` (every trial) and
``truth_rt_lt_max_t`` (trials that finished inside the window); the gate judges
``truth``, and the two only differ for parameter draws where a visible share of
trials outlasts 20 s.

Trust: G2 unpickles the ``*_network_config.pickle`` sitting next to the ONNX,
because that is the only format lanfactory writes it in, and unpickling runs
whatever the file says. Point this at artifact folders you produced or fetched
from a repository you control. G2 skips itself when the flax sibling is absent,
so validating a bare downloaded ``{model}.onnx`` reads no pickle at all.
