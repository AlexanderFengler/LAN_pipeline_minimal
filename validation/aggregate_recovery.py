"""Turn a directory of recovery shards into one verdict, for any model.

The recipe is written out in `recovery_designs.py`; this file is the part that
turns a pile of fits into a pass/fail. Nothing here knows what model it is
reading — shards carry their own model name and the cells are keyed by it, so
one directory can hold a whole catalogue.

Coverage is the statistic that tests the *likelihood*: a calibrated one puts
the truth inside its 94% interval 94% of the time, however wide that interval
is. Contraction is the statistic that tests the *design*: it says how much the
data narrowed the posterior relative to the prior. Reading them together is
what separates the two failure modes:

                    narrow posterior          wide posterior
    covers truth    identifiable, correct     unidentifiable, but honest
    misses truth    THE NETWORK IS WRONG      wrong and vague

So coverage is gated and contraction is only ever reported. A wide-but-covering
posterior is the model telling the truth about what the data support, and
failing a network for it would be punishing honesty.

Attribution needs a reference that contains no network, and there are two,
tried in that order:

  1. **The analytical arm**, where the model has one. It shares data and priors
     with the network arm, so a shortfall both arms show is the design's
     identifiability limit while one only the network shows is the network's.
  2. **The ladder**, for the majority of models that have no analytical form.
     A design limit relaxes when you add trials or conditions; a broken
     likelihood does not. So a shortfall that a richer rung repairs is charged
     to the design, and one that is flat across the whole ladder is charged to
     the network — with the weaker attribution said out loud in the failure
     text, because it is weaker.
