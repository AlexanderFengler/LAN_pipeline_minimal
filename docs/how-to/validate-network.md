# Validate and inspect a candidate network

Validation asks a narrow operational question: will HSSM load this ONNX
likelihood and obtain numerically and scientifically plausible values? Run it
on artifacts you trust before any publication attempt.

## Install the validation profile

```bash
uv sync --locked --group validate
```

This adds HSSM and ONNX Runtime to the normal pipeline environment. The docs
environment is intentionally separate and cannot run these gates.

## Run the LAN gates

```bash
uv run python validation/validate_network.py \
  --onnx-path /path/to/run_uuid_lan_ddm__network.onnx \
  --model-name ddm \
  --network-type lan
```

The command writes `validation_report.json` next to the ONNX unless
`--report-path` is given. It prints one compact JSON line and exits non-zero
when a gate fails.

| Gate | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| G1 `structure` | ONNX loads; all input dimensions are concrete; there is one input, one scalar output, and the input width matches the model |
| G2 `parity` | The exported ONNX matches the JAX trainer state when the required siblings exist |
| G3 `hssm_load` | HSSM accepts the likelihood and obtains a finite initial log probability |
| G4 `density` | Integrated mass is near one and Hellinger error is acceptable relative to a measured simulator sampling floor, at five draws from the 10 %-shrunk box |
| G5 `mass_survey` | Total mass is near one across the *whole* training box: 20 000 draws on LANfactory's onset-refined grid, judged on the tails of `|total − 1|` (advisory; see below) |

G2 legitimately skips for Torch artifacts and for a bare ONNX without the JAX
state/config pair. G1, G3, and G4 are required for publication; G5 is
advisory and skips itself under the locked LANfactory. A skipped gate
may carry `passed: true` in the detailed report to mean it did not itself fail;
inspect the compact `gates` states rather than treating that as evidence the
check ran.

## The mass survey (G5)

A LAN is a density, so its mass summed over choices and integrated over
reaction time should be one at every θ in the training box. G4 checks that at
five θ drawn from the box shrunk by 10 % a side, which is where most fits
live — and it is blind to the edge. A survey of the published `ddm` LAN at
20 000 θ over the full box found a median `|total − 1|` of 0.0037 but a p99 of
0.080, a range of 0.877–1.219, and 1.9 % of the box beyond 0.05, all of it in
two regions at the box edge (a > 2.2 with |v| < 0.5, where the tail is
over-estimated by up to +0.22; and v > 2.5, z > 0.8, a > 2.2, where the peak
is under-estimated by −0.12). G4 would fail that network with probability
0.06 %: five draws from the shrunk box almost never land there, and the
0.9–1.1 band is wider than the deviation anyway.

G5 runs LANfactory's `lanfactory.derive.survey` — uniform θ over the full box,
total mass on the *onset-refined* grid — and judges the tails of the
`|total − 1|` distribution. The grid matters: a uniform 1000-point grid carries
15–25 % quadrature error at a < 0.5, which the survey would otherwise blame on
the network. The whole survey dict (per-parameter bins, the worst cell, the
shrunk-box subset, any leak of mass below the onset) is recorded in the gate
so a deviation can be located, together with the `seconds` it took.

| Verdict | Rule | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fail | `total.p99_abs_dev > 0.10` or `total.frac_gt_0.10 > 0.02` | The gate fails and the report fails |
| warn | `total.p99_abs_dev > 0.05` or `total.frac_gt_0.05 > 0.01` | The gate passes with a `warning` detail |
| pass | neither | — |

The published `ddm` LAN, which is in production and demonstrably usable, lands
in *warn*: the warn line sits under its p99 and the fail line above it.

The thresholds are **provisional**. They are set from that one survey and are
to be frozen after the four modern LANs (`ddm_sdv`, `gamma_drift`,
`gamma_drift_angle`, `angle_extended`) have been surveyed. Until then
`--mass-survey-p99-max` (default `0.10`) and
`--mass-survey-frac-gt-0.10-max` (default `0.02`) let the freezing run change
them without a code change; record a changed threshold in the report, and do
not loosen one to pass a candidate.

!!! note "G5 skips itself until the lock moves"

    The survey lives in LANfactory's `derive` package, which the locked
    LANfactory (git `main`) does not have yet. Until the lock is refreshed
    after that work merges, G5 is reported as `skipped` with the reason
    `lanfactory.derive not available; refresh the lock after LANfactory L1
    merges`, and activates by itself once `lanfactory.derive` imports. The
    publisher does not require G5, so the skip never blocks a publish; a
    failing G5, once it runs, refuses one like any other failed gate.
    `--skip-mass-survey` shortens a diagnostic run the way `--skip-density`
    does.

!!! danger "Only validate trusted artifact folders"

    The parity gate unpickles the sibling `*_network_config.pickle`. Unpickling
    can execute code. Validate folders you produced or fetched from a repository
    you control; do not point the command at arbitrary downloads.

## Use skips only for diagnosis

`--skip-hssm` and `--skip-density` shorten a diagnostic run, but do not create
publishable evidence. In particular, the publisher refuses any report where a
required gate is skipped or missing.

If the density comparison needs a reviewed tolerance change, pass
`--hellinger-ratio-max` and preserve the resulting threshold in the report.
Do not loosen it merely to turn one candidate green.

## Validate an auxiliary network (cpn, opn, gonogo)

Auxiliary networks are not densities, so the density gate does not apply to
them. They share G1 and G2 with a LAN and then run their own pair:

```bash
uv run python validation/validate_network.py \
  --onnx-path /path/to/run_uuid_opn_ddm__network.onnx \
  --model-name ddm \
  --network-type opn
```

`--model-name` is always the base model. Pass `ddm`, never `ddm_deadline`: the
deadline variant is derived internally wherever a simulation needs it, and the
command rejects a `_deadline` name outright.

| Gate | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| G1 `structure` | As for a LAN, with the width contract `n_params + 1`: `[θ…, choice]` for a cpn, `[θ…, deadline]` for an opn or gonogo |
| G2 `parity` | As for a LAN |
| A3 `hssm_missing_load` | HSSM accepts the network as `loglik_missing_data` next to the base LAN and obtains a finite initial log probability on simulated data with missing rows, at `p_outlier = 0` and at HSSM's default lapse |
| A4 `accuracy` | The network's probability tracks a Monte-Carlo truth at 20 parameter draws stratified over the full box: `P(choice | θ)` for a cpn, `P(rt > deadline | θ)` for an opn |

The network's output must already be a log-probability (log-sigmoid baked into
the graph, every value ≤ 0). A raw-logit export fails A4 before any truth is
simulated.

A4's 20 draws are two strata of 10: the `core` stratum comes from the box
shrunk by 10 % a side, as before; the `edge` stratum is drawn uniformly from
the full box and kept only when it falls *outside* the shrunk box. The shrunk
box misses exactly the regions where the published `ddm` LAN's mass is off by
10–20 % (see the mass survey above), and an auxiliary network derived from
that LAN inherits the error there. Every draw records its `stratum`; when
`--lan-onnx` is given and `lanfactory.derive` is importable, it also records
the base LAN's `total_mass` at that θ (integrated on the onset-refined grid),
so a failing draw can be attributed to the LAN rather than to the derived net.
Without either, `total_mass` is `null`. The pass rule and its thresholds are
unchanged.

`--aux-category` names what the network's output is the probability of:
`choice` for a cpn, `omission` for an opn, `nogo` for a gonogo. That is the
vocabulary LANfactory's derived corpora and the publisher's provenance carry,
and each type has exactly one value, so the flag defaults to it; an explicit
value that does not match (say `deadline` for an opn) is rejected naming the
expected one. The report carries the resolved value as top-level
`aux_category`.

A3 resolves the base LAN by model name through HSSM, which downloads it for
registry models. Pass `--lan-onnx` to use a local LAN instead; models outside
HSSM's registry require it. Either way the assembly is LAN + auxiliary net
(`loglik_kind="approx_differentiable"`), never HSSM's analytical likelihood.

`lan-publish` runs the same gates for a cpn or opn, passing `--aux-category
choice` for a cpn itself and forwarding `--lan-onnx`; see
[Publish an auxiliary network](stage-and-publish.md#publish-an-auxiliary-network-cpn-opn)
for what the training run must carry. A gonogo can be validated here but is
never published.

Two skips are built in and reported rather than silent:

- A gonogo network has no HSSM consumer, so A3 and A4 are `skipped` with the
  reason `HSSM has no gonogo consumer`. Only G1 and G2 judge it.
- The cpn A3 gate needs an HSSM that passes `response` to the network on
  missing rows (HSSM ≥ 0.6.0). Under an older HSSM it is `skipped` with the
  reason `HSSM < 0.6.0 ignores response on missing rows`, and activates by
  itself once the locked HSSM moves.

`--skip-accuracy` shortens a diagnostic run the way `--skip-density` does for a
LAN. The A4 thresholds (`--accuracy-mean-abs-max`, default `0.01`, and
`--accuracy-max-abs-max`, default `0.03`) are provisional: they are to be
calibrated once on the first `ddm_sdv` gate run and then frozen. Record a
changed threshold in the report; do not loosen it to pass one candidate.

!!! note "The cpn truth counts every trial"

    ssm-simulators does not censor a base model at `max_t`: a trial that has
    not terminated by then comes back at `rt ≈ max_t + t` with its
    sign-implied choice, while a derived cpn integrates only up to 20 s. A4
    judges the all-trials proportion and records the windowed one as
    `truth_rt_lt_max_t` on every draw, so the two can be compared where a
    visible share of trials outlasts the window.

## Inspect the result visually

The marimo inspector compares the network's implied likelihood with simulator
KDEs and shows a parameter manifold. It explains a gate result; it does not
replace one.

```bash
export INSPECT_ONNX="/path/to/run_uuid_lan_ddm__network.onnx"
export INSPECT_MODEL="ddm"
uv run --group inspect marimo edit validation/inspect_network.py
```

To produce a static local report without opening an editor:

```bash
uv run --group inspect marimo export html validation/inspect_network.py \
  -o inspection.html
```

If `validation_report.json` is present, the inspector displays it only when its
recorded ONNX filename matches the artifact being viewed.
